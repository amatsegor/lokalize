# Lokalize - convert your Google Sheet to a localization file you need

## Credits

First of all - credits to [xavierha](https://github.com/xavierha/localize-with-spreadsheet) - this project may be considered as a fork of that one.

The concept and ~50% of an implementation I've took from that project, only converting it to Kotlin.

As an Android developer I've used an original `localize-with-spreadsheet` for 2+ years and that was fine (excepting that it doesn't support string-array's)

## Description

This app/module helps you to convert a specifically-formatted Google Sheet containing localization strings for different languages into a format used by the most popular platforms/langs, such as:

* Android
* iOS
* .NET
* Dart (hey, [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)!)
* Dart template

It's written using a multi-platform projects feature of Kotlin language
